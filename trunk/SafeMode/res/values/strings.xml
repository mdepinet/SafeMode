    To get started, select contacts to add to your blacklist (by using the \"Edit Blacklist\" option in the menu).
    \n\nThen you can start SafeMode by pushing the \"Start SafeMode\" button.  This will ask you for a time at which SafeMode will turn off automatically.
    \n\nUntil the time selected, the contacts in your blacklist will be unavailable (so that you cannot call, text, email, or IM them).
    \n\nTo turn off SafeMode early, you may push the \"End SafeMode\" button.  This will require you to prove sobriety, then turn off SafeMode.
    \n\nNow then, enjoy your party!
    \n
    \nSafeMode --Keeping you responsible while you\'re being irresponsible.
